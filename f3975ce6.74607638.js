"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Conflux employs account model and supports the smart contract. Its smart\ncontract is compatible with Solidity, which is Turing complete, as used in\nEthereum. Conlux uses merkle patricia tree as the major structure for its\nauthenticated storage used for the states of the accounts and the smart\ncontracts. Instead of using a single multi-version merkle tree, Conflux uses\nmultiple merkle trees for each version of the states. High-level speaking, it\nconsists of a snapshot tree and the delta trees. The delta tree is always held\nin memory and it contains all the state updates from the last snapshot. The\nsnapshot tree, instead, is read-only during the execution of the transactions.\nThis design makes the transaction execution in Conflux more efficient because it\ncan utilize the memory more effectively when accessing the state in the storage.\nThe delta tree typically contains the most frequently accessed data, and since\nthe state size is small in delta tree, the depth of the tree can also be\nshallow, which makes the memory be able to hold more effective data.  "),Object(a.b)("p",null,"In addition, Conflux employs a novel transaction relay protocol to improve the\neffective utilization of the network bandwidth for transaction propagation\nsince, in Conflux, the network bandwidth could become the real bottleneck. In\norder to reduce the redundant transaction propagation, a Conflux node first\nsends out to its peers an announcement containing the transaction ids that the\npeers may not have seen before, and then let the peers request the transactions\nthat they really need. Conflux introduces an efficient encoding for the\ntransaction id to achieve a good trade-off between the size and the security.
